# interactive football analysis tool

The application can be accessed on https://inigoferjagoba.shinyapps.io/DataVisualization/ 
In this project, we used a dataset that includes 41,865 results of international football matches starting from the very first official match in 1972 up to 2017. The matches range from FIFA World Cup to FIFI Wild Cup to regular friendly matches (the matches are strictly men's full internationals). This dataset was taken from kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/martj42/international-football-results-from-1872-to-2017).

The created interactive football analysis tool tries to answer three different questions using visualizations:
1. How much, if at all, does hosting a major tournament help a country's chances in the tournament?
2. Analyze historical trends on international football
3. Geopolitics relation with international football matches
